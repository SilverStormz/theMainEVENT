For the project the initial plan was to have it split when triggered into to more puffballs but i can't figure it out.
if you need to make it bigger wave the mouse around the puffball it grows 
there is a limit to puffball's growth 
when he reaches the limit he moves on x axis alone
i got the puff ball image from http://object-shows.wikia.com/wiki/Puffball
