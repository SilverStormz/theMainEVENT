For my project i created a radio, to play four different songs.

I use the processing.org examples for playing the songs and the button were based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5yoAsXWtOs&t=714s

Each song was gotten from Freesound Pixaby except Ifetiwa that was created for me by my friend Bliizzy (You can check out his music on Apple and spotify or wherever you stream your music)
