For my project i created a radio, to play four different songs.

I use the processing.org examples for playing the songs and the button were based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5yoAsXWtOs&t=714s

Each song was gotten from Freesound Pixaby and freesound.org except Ifetiwa that was created for me by my friend Bliizzy (You can check out his music on Apple and spotify or wherever you stream your music) ps the beat was a gift.

To play the sound you have to hold down on the buttons. 
For buttton number 4, a circle gets pumped according to the beat.
